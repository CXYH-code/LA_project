The Ducks’ School
Welcome to The Ducks' School, where students may choose their ideal course based on many approaches.
In Ducks' School, we use information about subjects they have studied and other students' subjects by employing the Recommended Systems approach, as well as the non-Personalized approach by visualizing different attributes of courses to students to assist them compare between the courses. The Ducks' School is user-friendly for students in all disciplines, not just IT.
The Ducks' School was developed as part of a Learning Analytics school project.
